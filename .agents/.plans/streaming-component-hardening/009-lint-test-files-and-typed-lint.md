## Status

- **Priority**: P2
- **Effort**: M
- **Risk**: MED
- **Depends on**: none (best done after 008 so fewer test files exist to fix)
- **Category**: dx
- **Planned at**: commit `939f154`, 2026-07-07

## Why this matters

Two lint blind spots in a promise-heavy streaming library:

1. `eslint.config.mjs` puts `'**/*.test.ts'` in the top-level `ignores`, so
   ~150 test files get **zero** static checking — the most bug-prone streaming/
   async tests (dangling `act()` promises, unrestored spies, accidental `.only`,
   unawaited `writeChunk`) ship unlinted.
2. The config uses `ts.configs.recommended` (not `recommendedTypeChecked`) and
   never sets `parserOptions.project`, so no type information reaches rules —
   `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises` and `no-misused-promises` are off.
   Those are exactly the rules that catch a dropped `await` in
   `parseAndCacheTokensAsync().then().catch()`, the rAF scheduling, and imperative
   `writeChunk` callers.

This is a real-bug-prevention change, not cosmetic. It is **effort M / risk MED**
because turning these on surfaces a batch of pre-existing violations to triage.

## Current state

`eslint.config.mjs:20-45` (abridged):

```js
ignores: [ /* ... */ '**/dist', '**/*.test.ts' ],   // line 30: test files ignored
// ...
js.configs.recommended,
...ts.configs.recommended,                            // line 34: NOT type-checked
...svelte.configs['flat/recommended'],
// ...
languageOptions: {
    // ...
    parserOptions: { tsconfigRootDir },               // lines 44-46: no `project`
},
```

Conventions: **never** use `eslint-disable` comments; use Trunk inline ignores
`// trunk-ignore(eslint/rule-name)` when a suppression is genuinely needed
(CLAUDE.md, "Code Style & Linting"). Formatting and linting run via Trunk:
`trunk fmt` (formatters, incl. prettier) then `trunk check` (eslint et al.).
CI runs on Node 22/24.

## Commands you will need

| Purpose     | Command                    | Expected on success |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Lint        | `trunk fmt && trunk check` | exit 0              |
| ESLint only | `pnpm exec eslint .`       | exit 0              |
| Typecheck   | `pnpm check`               | exit 0              |
| All unit    | `pnpm test:only`           | all pass            |

## Scope

**In scope**:

- `eslint.config.mjs` — remove the test-file ignore, add a test override block,
  enable typed linting.
- Possibly a lint-oriented tsconfig include if typed linting needs it (see
  Step 2). Do not change `tsconfig.json`'s compile behavior for the build.
- Source/test files **only** to fix violations the newly-enabled rules surface
  (minimal, mechanical fixes — add missing `await`, restore spies, etc.).

**Out of scope**:

- Rewriting tests beyond what a rule violation requires.
- Adding new runtime features.
- Changing Prettier config.

## Git workflow

- Branch: `advisor/009-lint-test-files-and-typed-lint` (`--no-track origin/main`).
- Commit style: `chore(lint): lint test files; enable type-aware promise rules`.
  Consider two commits: one config change, one violations-fix.
- Do NOT push or open a PR unless instructed.

## Steps

### Step 1: Lint test files with a sensible override

Remove `'**/*.test.ts'` from the top-level `ignores`. Add a flat-config override
block scoped to `**/*.test.ts` that relaxes rules that don't fit tests (e.g.
allow non-null assertions or `any` where the existing tests rely on them) — but
keep correctness rules on. Run ESLint and triage what surfaces.

**Verify**: `pnpm exec eslint .` runs over test files (no longer skipped). Fix
surfaced violations minimally, or relax clearly test-inappropriate rules in the
override. Target: `pnpm exec eslint .` → exit 0.

### Step 2: Enable type-aware linting for the promise rules

Switch from `ts.configs.recommended` to including
`ts.configs.recommendedTypeChecked` (typescript-eslint flat presets) and set
`parserOptions.projectService: true` (or `project: ['./tsconfig.json']`) so type
info is available. Then ensure `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises` and
`@typescript-eslint/no-misused-promises` are enabled (they come on with the
type-checked preset).

Typed linting is slower and will surface violations — expect some in
`SvelteMarkdown.svelte` (the `.then().catch()` async parse), `scheduleAppendFlush`,
and tests. Fix each **minimally and correctly**: prefer adding `await` or
`void`-marking a genuinely fire-and-forget promise (with a brief comment on why),
not blanket-disabling the rule. Where a Svelte `$effect` legitimately can't await,
use `void promise` with a one-line rationale.

If enabling `projectService`/`project` makes ESLint fail to resolve `.svelte`
files or explodes the lint time unacceptably, **STOP and report** with the error
— typed linting across Svelte + TS can need extra parser config
(`svelte-eslint-parser` `parserOptions.parser`), which may exceed this plan's
risk budget.

**Verify**: `trunk fmt && trunk check` → exit 0 with the new rules active.

### Step 3: Prove a floating promise is now caught (guard)

Temporarily introduce an obvious floating promise in a scratch spot (e.g. a
`Promise.resolve()` statement with no `await`/`void` in a `.ts` file under
`src/lib`), run `pnpm exec eslint .`, and confirm it reports
`no-floating-promises`. Then revert the scratch change. This proves the rule is
actually wired to type info, not silently inactive. Document the result in your
report (do not commit the scratch change).

**Verify**: ESLint flags the scratch floating promise; after revert,
`trunk fmt && trunk check` → exit 0.

### Step 4: Full suite

**Verify**: `pnpm check` → 0; `pnpm test:only` → all pass; `trunk fmt && trunk check` → 0.

## Test plan

- No new unit tests (this is tooling). The guard is Step 3 (rule provably active)
  plus a green `pnpm test:only` after any violation fixes.
- Verification: `trunk fmt && trunk check` → exit 0; `pnpm test:only` → all pass.

## Done criteria

ALL must hold:

- [ ] `'**/*.test.ts'` is no longer in the top-level `ignores` of
      `eslint.config.mjs`.
- [ ] `no-floating-promises` is active and provably catches a floating promise
      (Step 3), then reverted.
- [ ] `trunk fmt && trunk check` exits 0 (all surfaced violations fixed or justified via Trunk
      inline ignore — never `eslint-disable`).
- [ ] `pnpm check` exits 0; `pnpm test:only` exits 0.
- [ ] No `eslint-disable` comments introduced (`grep -rn "eslint-disable" src`
      shows none added by this change).
- [ ] The batch `README.md` status row for 009 is updated.

## STOP conditions

- `eslint.config.mjs` no longer matches the excerpt (drift).
- Typed linting cannot resolve `.svelte` files without parser rework beyond a
  small config addition, or lint time becomes unacceptable — report the error and
  the partial progress (Step 1's test-file linting may still be shippable alone).
- The surfaced violations reveal a **real** floating-promise bug in
  `src/lib/**` (not just tests) — fix it if trivial, but flag it prominently in
  your report as a correctness find, not just a lint cleanup.

## Maintenance notes

- Once typed linting is on, keep `parserOptions` pointed at a tsconfig that
  includes new source dirs, or new files silently lose type-aware coverage.
- Reviewer should check that fire-and-forget promises marked `void` are genuinely
  safe to not await (each should have a one-line rationale), and that no rule was
  blanket-disabled to force green.
- If this plan stalls at Step 2, shipping Step 1 alone (linting test files with
  the untyped preset) is still a net win.
