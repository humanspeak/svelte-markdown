### Testing Setup

- Vitest configuration with extensive edge case coverage
- JSDOM environment for DOM manipulation testing
- Testing Library integration for component testing
- Coverage reporting with minimum 90% threshold
- Playwright E2E test suites for:
    - Cross-version compatibility
    - Browser compatibility matrix
    - Visual regression snapshots
    - Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
- Specialized test suites for:
    - Malformed markdown input
    - Unicode and special character handling
    - Nested component scenarios
    - Memory leak prevention
    - Large document performance
    - Concurrent rendering scenarios

### Edge Case Handling

- Input Validation
    - Empty markdown strings
    - Non-string inputs
    - Malformed HTML within markdown
    - Extended Unicode characters
    - Zero-width spaces and invisible characters

- Component Behavior
    - Recursive component rendering
    - Circular reference detection
    - Dynamic component loading
    - Error boundary implementation
    - Memory management for large documents

- Performance Considerations
    - Chunked rendering for large documents
    - Lazy loading for complex syntax
    - Resource cleanup on unmount
    - Debounced updates for live editing

## Quality Assurance
